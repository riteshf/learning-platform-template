# Day 1: Python Basics & Environment Setup

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Introduction to Python programming fundamentals

Today you'll set up your Python development environment and learn the basics of Python syntax, including variables, data types, operators, and input/output operations.

Navigate today: Start with [Pre-class](./pre-class/) → then [Live](./live/) → complete [Post-class](./post-class/).

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Simple Calculator Program

Create a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for two numbers
2. Asks the user for an operation (+, -, *, /)
3. Performs the operation
4. Displays the result

**Requirements:**
- Use `input()` to get user input
- Handle different operations
- Display results clearly
- Add error handling for division by zero

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `calculator.py`
- Test with different inputs
- Be ready to share your solution in the next class
