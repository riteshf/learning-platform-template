# Day 2: Control Flow & Functions

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Control flow statements and functions in Python

Today you'll learn how to control program flow using conditionals and loops, and how to create reusable code using functions.

---

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 1 concepts (variables, data types, operators)
- [Python Control Flow](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
- Basic concepts of if/else statements and loops

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 1 assignments
- Understanding of variables and operators

---

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **Conditional Statements**
   - `if`, `elif`, `else`
   - Nested conditionals
   - Logical operators in conditionals

2. **Loops**
   - `for` loops
   - `while` loops
   - Loop control (`break`, `continue`)
   - Nested loops

3. **Functions**
   - Function definition and calling
   - Parameters and arguments
   - Return values
   - Scope and local vs global variables
   - Default parameters

### Hands-on Exercises
- Conditional logic exercises
- Loop-based problems
- Function creation and usage
- Combining control flow and functions

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Number Guessing Game

Create a Python program that:
1. Generates a random number between 1 and 100
2. Asks the user to guess the number
3. Provides hints (too high/too low)
4. Tracks the number of attempts
5. Congratulates the user when they guess correctly

**Requirements:**
- Use `random` module for number generation
- Use loops for repeated guessing
- Use conditionals for hints
- Use functions to organize code
- Display attempt count

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `guessing_game.py`
- Test with different scenarios
- Be ready to share your solution
