# Day 3: Data Structures

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Python data structures - lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

Today you'll learn about Python's built-in data structures and how to use them effectively for organizing and manipulating data.

---

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 2 concepts (conditionals, loops, functions)
- [Python Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- Basic concepts of lists and dictionaries

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 2 assignments
- Understanding of variables and functions

---

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **Lists**
   - Creating and accessing lists
   - List methods (append, extend, insert, remove, pop)
   - List slicing
   - List comprehensions

2. **Tuples**
   - Creating tuples
   - Tuple vs list
   - Tuple unpacking

3. **Dictionaries**
   - Creating dictionaries
   - Accessing and modifying values
   - Dictionary methods (keys, values, items)
   - Dictionary comprehensions

4. **Sets**
   - Creating sets
   - Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
   - Set comprehensions

### Hands-on Exercises
- List manipulation exercises
- Dictionary operations
- Data structure combinations
- List and dictionary comprehensions

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Student Grade Management System

Create a Python program that:
1. Stores student information (name, ID, grades) using dictionaries
2. Allows adding new students
3. Calculates average grades for each student
4. Finds students with grades above a threshold
5. Displays student information in a formatted way

**Requirements:**
- Use dictionaries to store student data
- Use lists for multiple grades
- Create functions for each operation
- Use list comprehensions where appropriate
- Handle edge cases (empty lists, invalid inputs)

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `grade_manager.py`
- Test with multiple students
- Be ready to share your solution
