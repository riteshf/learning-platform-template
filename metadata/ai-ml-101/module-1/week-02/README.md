# Week 2: Python for Data Science

## Overview

**Duration:** 3 sessions  
**Focus:** File operations, NumPy, and Pandas introduction

This week introduces you to the essential Python libraries for data science. You'll learn to work with files, manipulate arrays with NumPy, and start working with data using Pandas.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Read and write files in Python
- Work with CSV and JSON files
- Use NumPy for array operations
- Use Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation
- Load and explore datasets
