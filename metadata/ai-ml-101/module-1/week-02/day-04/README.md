# Day 4: Working with Files & Libraries

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** File operations and introduction to NumPy

Today you'll learn how to read and write files in Python, work with CSV and JSON formats, and get introduced to the NumPy library for numerical computing.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 3 concepts (data structures)
- [Python File I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)
- [NumPy Quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

### Setup Instructions
1. Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
2. Create a sample CSV file for practice
3. Review file path concepts (absolute vs relative)

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 3 assignments
- Understanding of data structures

---

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **File Operations**
   - Opening and closing files
   - Reading files (read, readline, readlines)
   - Writing to files
   - File modes (r, w, a, x)

2. **Working with CSV Files**
   - Reading CSV files
   - Writing CSV files
   - Using csv module

3. **Working with JSON Files**
   - Reading JSON files
   - Writing JSON files
   - Using json module

4. **NumPy Introduction**
   - Installing NumPy
   - Creating arrays
   - Basic array operations
   - Array attributes

### Hands-on Exercises
- File reading and writing exercises
- CSV data processing
- JSON data manipulation
- Basic NumPy array operations

---

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Data File Processing Exercise

Create a Python program that:
1. Reads data from a CSV file
2. Reads data from a JSON file
3. Processes and combines the data
4. Writes the processed data to a new CSV file
5. Uses NumPy for any numerical operations

**Requirements:**
- Handle file errors gracefully
- Use appropriate file modes
- Process data from both file types
- Create clean, readable output

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `file_processor.py`
- Include sample input files
- Be ready to share your solution
