# Day 5: NumPy & Array Operations

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** NumPy arrays, indexing, operations, and broadcasting

Today you'll dive deeper into NumPy, learning advanced array operations, indexing techniques, and how to perform efficient numerical computations.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 4 concepts (file operations, NumPy basics)
- [NumPy Array Creation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.creation.html)
- [NumPy Indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html)

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 4 assignments
- Understanding of basic NumPy arrays

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **Array Creation**
   - Creating arrays from lists
   - Special arrays (zeros, ones, arange, linspace)
   - Array shapes and dimensions

2. **Array Indexing and Slicing**
   - Basic indexing
   - Boolean indexing
   - Fancy indexing
   - Multi-dimensional indexing

3. **Array Operations**
   - Mathematical operations
   - Statistical functions
   - Array manipulation (reshape, transpose)
   - Element-wise operations

4. **Broadcasting**
   - Understanding broadcasting rules
   - Broadcasting examples
   - When to use broadcasting

### Hands-on Exercises
- Array creation exercises
- Indexing and slicing practice
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting examples

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Matrix Operations Practice

Create a Python program that:
1. Creates matrices using NumPy
2. Performs matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose)
3. Calculates matrix statistics (mean, sum, max, min)
4. Solves a simple matrix equation
5. Visualizes matrix operations

**Requirements:**
- Use NumPy for all operations
- Handle different matrix sizes
- Include error handling
- Document your code

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `matrix_operations.py`
- Include examples with different matrix sizes
- Be ready to share your solution
