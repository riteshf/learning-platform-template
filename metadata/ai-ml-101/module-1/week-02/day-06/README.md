# Day 6: Pandas Introduction

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Introduction to Pandas DataFrames and Series

Today you'll learn about Pandas, the most important library for data analysis in Python. You'll work with DataFrames and Series to load, explore, and manipulate data.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: CSV Data Analysis Exercise

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a CSV dataset using Pandas
2. Explores the dataset (shape, info, describe)
3. Selects specific columns
4. Filters rows based on conditions
5. Calculates basic statistics
6. Exports results to a new file

**Requirements:**

- Handle missing values appropriately
- Include data exploration steps
- Create clear output

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `data_analysis.py`
- Include the dataset you used
- Be ready to share your solution
