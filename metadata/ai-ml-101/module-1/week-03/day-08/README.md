# Day 8: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Data cleaning techniques and preprocessing

Today you'll learn essential data cleaning techniques to prepare datasets for analysis, including handling missing values, duplicates, and data type issues.

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identifying missing values
   - Dropping missing values
   - Filling missing values (mean, median, mode, forward fill)
   - Interpolation methods

2. **Handling Duplicates**
   - Finding duplicates
   - Removing duplicates
   - Keeping first/last occurrence

3. **Data Type Conversions**
   - Converting data types
   - Handling date/time columns
   - Converting categorical data

4. **Data Validation**
   - Checking data ranges
   - Identifying outliers
   - Data quality checks

### Hands-on Exercises

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Clean a Messy Dataset

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a messy dataset (with missing values, duplicates, wrong types)
2. Identifies all data quality issues
3. Handles missing values appropriately
4. Removes duplicates
5. Converts data types correctly
6. Validates the cleaned data
7. Exports the cleaned dataset

**Requirements:**
- Document all cleaning steps
- Justify your cleaning decisions
- Handle edge cases
- Create a clean, reproducible workflow

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `data_cleaning.py`
- Include before/after data samples
- Be ready to explain your cleaning process
