# Day 9: Data Visualization

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Creating data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Today you'll learn to create effective data visualizations to explore and communicate insights from your data.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 8 concepts (data cleaning)
- [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
- [Seaborn Tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)

### Setup Instructions
1. Install: `pip install matplotlib seaborn`
2. Review basic plotting concepts
3. Look at example visualizations

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 8 assignments
- Understanding of cleaned data

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **Matplotlib Basics**
   - Creating simple plots
   - Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots
   - Customizing plots (labels, titles, colors)
   - Subplots

2. **Seaborn Introduction**
   - Seaborn vs Matplotlib
   - Statistical plotting
   - Distribution plots
   - Categorical plots

3. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Heatmaps
   - Pair plots
   - Facet grids
   - Custom styling

4. **Best Practices**
   - Choosing the right chart type
   - Color schemes
   - Labels and annotations
   - Exporting plots

### Hands-on Exercises

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Create Visualization Dashboard

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a dataset
2. Creates at least 5 different types of visualizations
3. Includes line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps
4. Customizes all plots with proper labels and titles
5. Combines plots into a dashboard layout
6. Exports the dashboard as an image

**Requirements:**
- Use both Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Create meaningful visualizations
- Include proper labels and legends
- Make plots publication-ready

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `visualization_dashboard.py`
- Include exported visualization images
- Be ready to present your dashboard
