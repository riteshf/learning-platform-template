# Day 14: Data Preprocessing for ML

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Preparing data for machine learning models

Today you'll learn essential data preprocessing techniques required before training machine learning models.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Preprocess a Dataset for ML

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a dataset
2. Splits data into train/test sets
3. Handles missing values
4. Scales numerical features
5. Encodes categorical variables
6. Selects relevant features
7. Saves preprocessed data

**Requirements:**
- Use scikit-learn preprocessing
- Document all steps
- Justify preprocessing choices
- Create reproducible pipeline

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `preprocessing_pipeline.py`
- Include before/after data samples
- Be ready to explain your choices
