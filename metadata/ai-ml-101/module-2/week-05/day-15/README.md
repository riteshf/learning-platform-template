# Day 15: Scikit-learn Basics

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Introduction to scikit-learn and building ML pipelines

Today you'll learn to use scikit-learn, the most popular Python library for machine learning, and build your first ML pipeline.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Build Your First ML Pipeline

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a dataset
2. Creates a preprocessing pipeline
3. Builds a simple ML model (e.g., Linear Regression or Logistic Regression)
4. Uses cross-validation for evaluation
5. Makes predictions on test data
6. Evaluates model performance

**Requirements:**

- Include preprocessing steps
- Use cross-validation
- Calculate evaluation metrics
- Document your code

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `ml_pipeline.py`
- Include model evaluation results
- Be ready to explain your pipeline
