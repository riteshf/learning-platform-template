# Day 16: Linear Regression

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Linear regression for predicting continuous values

Today you'll learn linear regression, one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate regression models.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Predict House Prices

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a house price dataset
2. Preprocesses the data
3. Builds a linear regression model
4. Trains the model on training data
5. Evaluates on test data using multiple metrics
6. Interprets the model coefficients
7. Makes predictions for new houses

**Requirements:**
- Use scikit-learn LinearRegression
- Calculate MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R²
- Visualize predictions vs actual values
- Interpret feature importance

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `house_price_prediction.py`
- Include evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Be ready to present your model
