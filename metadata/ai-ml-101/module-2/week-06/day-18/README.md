# Day 18: Regression Project

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** End-to-end regression project

Today you'll work on a comprehensive regression project that combines all the concepts learned this week.

---

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review all Week 6 concepts
- Choose a regression dataset (e.g., Boston Housing, California Housing)
- Plan your project approach

### Prerequisites
- Completed Days 16-17 assignments
- Understanding of regression techniques

---

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Project Work Session

You'll work on building a complete regression solution:

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Load and explore dataset
   - Understand features and target
   - Identify data quality issues

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale features
   - Split data

3. **Model Building**
   - Try multiple regression models
   - Apply regularization if needed
   - Tune hyperparameters

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate on test set
   - Compare models
   - Analyze errors

5. **Presentation**
   - Present your solution
   - Explain choices
   - Discuss results

---

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Complete and Submit Project

Complete your regression project:
1. Finalize your model
2. Create visualizations
3. Write documentation
4. Prepare presentation
5. Submit all files

**Requirements:**
- Complete end-to-end pipeline
- Well-documented code
- Clear visualizations
- Comprehensive evaluation
- Professional presentation

**Submission:**
- Code files
- Documentation
- Visualizations
- Presentation slides (if applicable)
