# Day 19: Logistic Regression

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Logistic regression for binary and multi-class classification

Today you'll learn logistic regression, a fundamental classification algorithm, and how to evaluate classification models.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Binary Classification Exercise

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a binary classification dataset
2. Preprocesses the data
3. Builds a logistic regression model
4. Trains and evaluates the model
5. Calculates all classification metrics
6. Creates confusion matrix and ROC curve
7. Interprets the results

**Requirements:**
- Use scikit-learn LogisticRegression
- Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Visualize confusion matrix and ROC curve
- Interpret probabilities

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `logistic_regression_classifier.py`
- Include all metrics and visualizations
- Be ready to explain your results
