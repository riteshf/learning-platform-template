# Day 20: Decision Trees & Random Forest

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Tree-based classification algorithms

Today you'll learn decision trees and random forests, powerful algorithms that can handle non-linear relationships and provide feature importance.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Classification Project with Trees

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a classification dataset
2. Builds a decision tree classifier
3. Builds a random forest classifier
4. Compares both models
5. Analyzes feature importance
6. Visualizes decision trees
7. Evaluates performance

**Requirements:**
- Use DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier
- Tune hyperparameters
- Visualize feature importance
- Compare model performance
- Document your findings

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `tree_classifiers.py`
- Include visualizations and comparisons
- Be ready to present your models
