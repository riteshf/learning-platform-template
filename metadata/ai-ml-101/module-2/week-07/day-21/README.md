# Day 21: SVM & KNN

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors

Today you'll learn two additional classification algorithms: SVM for complex decision boundaries and KNN for instance-based learning.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Compare Different Classifiers

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a classification dataset
2. Builds multiple classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - SVM
   - KNN
3. Evaluates all models
4. Compares performance
5. Selects the best model
6. Analyzes why certain models perform better

**Requirements:**
- Use all classifiers learned
- Use cross-validation
- Create comparison table
- Visualize results
- Document findings

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `classifier_comparison.py`
- Include comparison results and analysis
- Be ready to present your findings
