# Week 8: Model Evaluation & Optimization

## Overview

**Duration:** 3 sessions  
**Focus:** Comprehensive model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection

This week focuses on evaluating models thoroughly, optimizing hyperparameters, and selecting the best models for production.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Evaluate models using multiple metrics
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Compare and select best models
- Understand bias-variance tradeoff
- Apply ML best practices
