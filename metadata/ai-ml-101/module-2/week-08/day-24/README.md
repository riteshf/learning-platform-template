# Day 24: Model Selection & Best Practices

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Selecting best models and ML best practices

Today you'll learn how to compare models, understand bias-variance tradeoff, and apply ML best practices for production-ready models.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Finalize Best Model for a Problem

Create a comprehensive model selection report that:
1. Defines the problem clearly
2. Evaluates multiple candidate models
3. Performs hyperparameter tuning
4. Compares models using multiple criteria
5. Analyzes bias-variance tradeoff
6. Selects best model with justification
7. Documents all decisions

**Requirements:**
- Evaluate at least 3 different models
- Use proper evaluation methodology
- Consider production requirements
- Document thoroughly
- Justify all choices

**Submission:**
- Code files
- Model comparison report
- Final model selection with justification
- Be ready to present your selection
