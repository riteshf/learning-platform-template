# Week 9: Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

**Duration:** 3 sessions  
**Focus:** Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques

This week introduces unsupervised learning, where we find patterns in data without labeled examples. You'll learn clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction.
