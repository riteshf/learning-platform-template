# Day 25: Clustering - K-Means

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** K-Means clustering algorithm

Today you'll learn K-Means, one of the most popular clustering algorithms, and how to apply it to find patterns in unlabeled data.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Customer Segmentation Project

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a customer dataset
2. Preprocesses the data
3. Applies K-Means clustering
4. Determines optimal number of clusters
5. Analyzes each cluster
6. Visualizes clusters
7. Generates insights about customer segments

**Requirements:**
- Use KMeans from scikit-learn
- Use elbow method and silhouette score
- Create visualizations
- Analyze cluster characteristics
- Provide actionable insights

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `customer_segmentation.py`
- Include visualizations and analysis
- Be ready to present your segments
