## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Engineer Features for a Dataset

Create a Python program that:
1. Loads a dataset
2. Performs advanced feature engineering:
   - Creates interaction features
   - Applies binning/discretization
   - Creates domain-specific features
   - Handles categorical variables
3. Performs feature selection
4. Compares model performance before/after
5. Documents all feature engineering steps

**Requirements:**
- Create at least 5 new features
- Use feature selection techniques
- Measure performance improvement
- Document all steps
- Justify feature choices

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `feature_engineering.py`
- Include before/after comparisons
- Be ready to explain your features
