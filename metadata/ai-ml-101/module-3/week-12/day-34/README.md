## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Create Advanced Prompts

Create advanced prompts for the following scenarios:
1. Role-based assistant (e.g., coding assistant, writing coach)
2. Structured data extraction (JSON output)
3. Function calling scenario (e.g., calculator, weather)
4. Multi-step reasoning task
5. Complex analysis with structured output

**Requirements:**
- Use advanced techniques learned
- Test each prompt
- Document approach
- Explain improvements over basic prompts

**Submission:**
- Save as `advanced_prompts.py` or `.md`
- Include prompts and examples
- Be ready to demonstrate your prompts
