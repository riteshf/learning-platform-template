# Week 13: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## Overview

**Duration:** 3 sessions  
**Focus:** Building RAG systems for knowledge-enhanced LLM applications

This week focuses on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), a technique that combines LLMs with external knowledge sources to provide accurate, context-aware responses.
