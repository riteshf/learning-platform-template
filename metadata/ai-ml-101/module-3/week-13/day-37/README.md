# Day 37: Introduction to RAG

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Understanding RAG architecture and components

Today you'll learn about RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), a powerful technique that enhances LLMs with external knowledge.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Week 12 concepts (prompt engineering)
- [RAG Introduction](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag)
- [Vector Databases](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/)

### Prerequisites
- Completed Week 12 assignments
- Understanding of LLMs

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **What is RAG?**
   - RAG definition
   - Why RAG matters
   - RAG vs fine-tuning
   - Use cases

2. **RAG Architecture**
   - Retrieval component
   - Generation component
   - How they work together
   - Data flow

3. **Vector Databases**
   - What are vector databases?
   - Embeddings
   - Similarity search
   - Popular options (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)

4. **Embeddings**
   - What are embeddings?
   - Embedding models
   - Creating embeddings
   - Embedding quality

### Hands-on Exercises
- Understanding RAG flow
- Exploring vector databases
- Creating embeddings
- Similarity search exercises

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Research Vector Database Options

Research and compare vector database options:
1. Compare at least 3 vector databases
2. Evaluate features and capabilities
3. Consider pricing and scalability
4. Assess ease of use
5. Make recommendations

**Requirements:**
- Research Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma (or alternatives)
- Compare features
- Consider use cases
- Document findings

**Submission:**
- Save as `vector_db_research.md`
- Be ready to discuss your findings
