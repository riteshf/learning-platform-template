# Day 38: Building RAG Systems

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Building RAG systems with LangChain

Today you'll learn to build RAG systems using LangChain, including document processing, chunking, and retrieval.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Day 37 concepts (RAG architecture)
- [LangChain RAG](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)
- [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/)

### Setup Instructions
1. Install: `pip install langchain openai chromadb`
2. Set up OpenAI API key
3. Prepare sample documents

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 37 assignments
- Understanding of RAG concepts

---

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **LangChain Introduction**
   - What is LangChain?
   - LangChain components
   - RAG with LangChain

2. **Document Processing**
   - Loading documents
   - Document loaders
   - Text splitting
   - Chunking strategies

3. **Building RAG Pipeline**
   - Document loading
   - Creating embeddings
   - Storing in vector store
   - Retrieval
   - Generation

4. **Implementation**
   - Setting up LangChain
   - Creating vector store
   - Building retrieval chain
   - Testing RAG system

### Hands-on Exercises
- Loading and processing documents
- Creating embeddings
- Building RAG pipeline
- Testing retrieval and generation

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Build a Simple RAG System

Create a RAG system that:
1. Loads documents (PDF, text, or web)
2. Splits documents into chunks
3. Creates embeddings
4. Stores in vector database
5. Retrieves relevant chunks
6. Generates answers using LLM
7. Tests with sample questions

**Requirements:**
- Use LangChain
- Handle document processing
- Implement retrieval
- Generate accurate responses
- Test with multiple questions

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `rag_system.py`
- Include sample documents
- Be ready to demonstrate your system
