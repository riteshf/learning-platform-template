# Day 40: Introduction to AI Agents

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Understanding AI agent architecture and concepts

Today you'll learn about AI agents - autonomous systems that can use tools, plan actions, and accomplish complex tasks.

## Pre-class (30 mins)

### Materials to Review
- Review Week 13 concepts (RAG)
- [AI Agents Introduction](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/agents)
- [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)

### Prerequisites
- Completed Week 13 assignments

## Live Session (2 hours)

### Topics Covered

1. **What are AI Agents?**
   - Agent definition
   - Agents vs chatbots
   - Agent capabilities
   - Use cases

2. **Agent Architecture**
   - LLM as reasoning engine
   - Tools and actions
   - Planning and execution
   - Memory and state

3. **Agent Components**
   - Tools (functions, APIs)
   - Planning (ReAct, Plan-and-Solve)
   - Memory (short-term, long-term)
   - Execution loop

4. **Agent Types**
   - ReAct agents
   - Plan-and-execute agents
   - Self-ask-with-search
   - Tool-using agents

### Hands-on Exercises
- Understanding agent flow
- Designing agent architectures
- Identifying agent use cases
- Planning agent systems

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Design an Agent Use Case

Design an AI agent system for a specific use case:
1. Define the problem
2. Identify required tools
3. Design agent architecture
4. Plan execution flow
5. Consider error handling
6. Document your design

**Requirements:**
- Choose a real-world use case
- Design complete system
- Identify all tools needed
- Plan agent behavior
- Document thoroughly

**Submission:**
- Save as `agent_design.md`
- Include architecture diagram
- Be ready to present your design
