# Day 41: Building AI Agents

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Building AI agents with LangChain and tool integration

Today you'll learn to build AI agents using LangChain, including tool creation, agent initialization, and execution.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Build a Simple Agent

Create an AI agent that:
1. Has at least 3 tools (e.g., calculator, web search, file operations)
2. Can handle multi-step tasks
3. Uses planning and execution
4. Handles errors gracefully
5. Provides clear outputs
6. Tests with various scenarios

**Requirements:**
- Use LangChain agents
- Create custom tools
- Handle tool execution
- Test thoroughly
- Document your agent

**Submission:**
- Save your code as `simple_agent.py`
- Include tool definitions
- Be ready to demonstrate your agent
