# Day 42: Multi-Agent Systems

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Building multi-agent systems with agent communication and orchestration

Today you'll learn to build systems with multiple agents that can communicate, collaborate, and orchestrate complex workflows.

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Design a Multi-Agent Solution

Design a multi-agent system for a complex task:
1. Identify the problem
2. Design agent roles
3. Plan agent communication
4. Design orchestration
5. Consider error handling
6. Document architecture

**Requirements:**
- Design system with at least 3 agents
- Define agent roles clearly
- Plan communication flow
- Design orchestration
- Document thoroughly

**Submission:**
- Save as `multi_agent_design.md`
- Include architecture and flow diagrams
- Be ready to present your design
