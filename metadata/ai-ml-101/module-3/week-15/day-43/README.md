# Day 43: Model Deployment Basics

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours live + 30 mins pre-class + 30 mins post-class  
**Focus:** Deploying ML models to production

Today you'll learn deployment strategies for ML models, including API creation, containerization, and cloud deployment.

   - API deployment
   - Edge deployment
   - Cloud deployment

2. **Creating APIs**
   - REST APIs
   - FastAPI introduction
   - API endpoints
   - Request/response handling

3. **Containerization**
   - Docker basics
   - Creating Dockerfiles
   - Containerizing ML models
   - Docker Compose

4. **Deployment Options**
   - Cloud platforms
   - Model serving frameworks
   - Serverless options
   - Cost considerations

### Hands-on Exercises
- Creating API endpoints
- Containerizing models
- Testing deployments
- Deploying to cloud

## Post-class (30 mins)

### Assignment: Deploy a Simple ML Model

Deploy a ML model as an API:
1. Choose a trained model
2. Create FastAPI application
3. Add prediction endpoint
4. Containerize with Docker
5. Test the API
6. Deploy (local or cloud)

**Requirements:**
- Use FastAPI
- Create Docker container
- Include API documentation
- Test thoroughly
- Document deployment

**Submission:**
- Code files
- Dockerfile
- Deployment documentation
- Be ready to demonstrate deployment
