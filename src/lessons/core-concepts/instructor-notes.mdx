## Instructor Notes: Core Concepts Lesson

**Created**: January 2025  
**Last Updated**: January 10, 2025  
**Duration**: 60 minutes (live session)

---

## 📋 Lesson Overview

This is the second lesson of the course, building on the introduction. The goal is to:

- Establish deep understanding of core principles
- Show how principles guide design decisions
- Demonstrate real-world applications
- Build confidence in applying concepts

## 🎯 Key Teaching Points

1. **The Five Pillars**
   - Start with everyday examples (car, LEGO, etc.)
   - Show how each principle solves real problems
   - Explain why ignoring them causes issues

2. **Design Patterns as Solutions**
   - Patterns aren't about being clever
   - Patterns represent collective wisdom
   - Right pattern for right situation

3. **Principles Over Rules**
   - SOLID principles guide decision-making
   - They're not dogma, use judgment
   - Context matters

## ⏱️ Timing Breakdown (60 min)

- **0-5 min**: Welcome & recap of introduction
  - Quick poll on pre-class comprehension
  - Set expectations for today's depth

- **5-20 min**: Foundations & Principles (Slides 1-2)
  - Live coding example: Show bad vs good abstraction
  - Interactive: "Spot the principle" exercise
  - Pause for Q&A

- **20-35 min**: Patterns (Slide 3)
  - Present 3 common patterns with real examples
  - Live poll: Q_CC_002 - Which principle matters most?
  - Discuss responses and why

- **35-50 min**: Best Practices & Patterns (Slides 4-5)
  - Walk through code review checklist
  - Present case studies (2-3 stories)
  - Discussion: What would you have done differently?

- **50-60 min**: Assessment & Q&A
  - Q_CC_003 - Pattern recognition quiz
  - Open discussion on real projects
  - Reminder about post-class assignment

## 💡 Instructor Tips

### Engagement Strategies

- **Use analogies**: "Abstraction is like a remote control..."
- **Live coding**: Nothing beats watching code come alive
- **Polling**: Keep people engaged (Q_CC_002)
- **Stories**: Share your own experiences with these principles
- **Mistakes**: Talk about times you violated these principles and learned

### Code Examples You'll Need

Prepare these live coding examples:

1. **Abstraction Example** (5 min)
   - Bad: Expose all internal details
   - Good: Clean interface
   - Show the difference in usability

2. **Pattern Example** (5 min)
   - Show code that needs a pattern
   - Refactor to use the pattern
   - Discuss pros/cons

3. **SOLID Violation** (5 min)
   - Show a God Object
   - Refactor to follow Single Responsibility
   - Measure improvement

### Handling Questions

| Question                       | Answer Strategy                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "Isn't this over-engineering?" | Agree! Show the cost of not doing it. |
| "When do I NOT use patterns?"  | Great question. Discuss trade-offs.   |
| "Can I mix patterns?"          | Yes, often necessary. Show example.   |
| "How do I know which is best?" | Experience + specific context.        |

## 📊 Assessment Strategy

### Q_CC_001 (Pre-class Checklist)

- Verify understanding of terminology
- Identify learners struggling with definitions
- Allocate extra 5 min if >30% score <70%

### Q_CC_002 (Live Poll)

- Gauge which principle resonates most
- Use responses to personalize examples
- "60% of you care most about X, let me show why..."

### Q_CC_003 (Pattern Recognition)

- Hands-on assessment during live session
- Good indicator of comprehension
- Review wrong answers to improve teaching

### Q_CC_004 (Post-class Quiz)

- 10 questions, mix conceptual and applied
- Target pass rate: 85%+
- Review failures to identify gaps

### Q_CC_005 (Real-World Assignment)

- Open-ended scenario
- Learners propose solutions
- Grade on reasoning + correctness

## 🔄 Common Misconceptions

| Misconception                       | Reality                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "More abstraction is always better" | Abstraction hides complexity. Too much and it confuses. |
| "You must use all SOLID principles" | Use them where they help. Context matters.              |
| "Patterns are required"             | Patterns are tools. Use them when appropriate.          |
| "Security is an afterthought"       | Security must be foundational.                          |

## 💻 Demo Code Snippets

Keep these ready to paste in your IDE:

```typescript
// Abstraction Example - Bad
class Car {
  private pistons = 1000;
  private cylinders = 4;
  private fuel = 50;

  public drive() {
    // User has to understand internals!
  }
}

// Abstraction Example - Good
class Car {
  public drive() {
    // User just calls drive()
  }
}
```

## 📋 Lesson Checklist

### Before Live Session (Day Before)

- [ ] Practice live coding demos 2-3 times
- [ ] Prepare slides (dry run through all 5)
- [ ] Test code examples in IDE
- [ ] Prepare poll questions backup
- [ ] Plan icebreaker or story to tell
- [ ] Check student pre-class completion rates
- [ ] Send reminder email

### During Live Session

- [ ] Start 5 min early for tech checks
- [ ] Share agenda at the start
- [ ] Use screen sharing + webcam
- [ ] Paste code examples clearly
- [ ] Monitor chat for questions
- [ ] Call on participants for engagement
- [ ] Record the entire session
- [ ] Watch timing (stay on schedule)

### After Live Session

- [ ] Compile Q&A transcript
- [ ] Share slides + code examples
- [ ] Highlight best student answers (anonymized)
- [ ] Share recording within 24 hours
- [ ] Add captions within 48 hours
- [ ] Review Q_CC_003 results
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't for next time

## 🎬 Recording & Distribution

- **Format**: Full video + slides overlay
- **Length**: ~50 min edited (remove dead air)
- **Captions**: Essential for accessibility
- **Audio**: Watch for echo/background noise
- **Video Quality**: 1080p preferred, 720p minimum

## 📞 Office Hours Prep

Likely office hours questions:

- "How do I convince my team to follow SOLID?"
- "What if the codebase doesn't allow patterns?"
- "How do I refactor existing code?"
- "When is it okay to take shortcuts?"
