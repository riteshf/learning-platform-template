## Instructor Notes: Core Concepts Lesson

Keep the scaffolding, let future instructors add depth.

### Focus points

- Move from rules to tradeoffs; show when principles bend
- Use one concrete refactor demo; compare before/after
- Tie Q_CC_002 (poll) to how you pace the live demo

### Flow (adjust timing freely)

- Recap intro and run poll Q_CC_002
- Slides 1-3: foundations, principles, patterns
- Live coding: pattern in action (keep to 10-15 minutes)
- Case study and questions

### Tips

- Use analogies sparingly; jump to code quickly
- Share one story where you broke a rule for a reason
- Keep Q_CC_003 handy for the live check

### Assignment handoff

If `Q_CC_001` is active, preview it and remind learners it follows lessons 1-2.
   - Good: Clean interface
   - Show the difference in usability

2. **Pattern Example**
   - Show code that needs a pattern
   - Refactor to use the pattern
   - Discuss pros/cons

3. **SOLID Violation**
   - Show a God Object
   - Refactor to follow Single Responsibility
   - Measure improvement

### Handling Questions

| Question                       | Answer Strategy                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "Isn't this over-engineering?" | Agree! Show the cost of not doing it. |
| "When do I NOT use patterns?"  | Great question. Discuss trade-offs.   |
| "Can I mix patterns?"          | Yes, often necessary. Show example.   |
| "How do I know which is best?" | Experience + specific context.        |

## 📊 Assessment Strategy

### Q_CC_001 (Pre-class Checklist)

- Verify understanding of terminology
- Identify learners struggling with definitions
- Allocate extra time if >30% score <70%

### Q_CC_002 (Live Poll)

- Gauge which principle resonates most
- Use responses to personalize examples
- "60% of you care most about X, let me show why..."

### Q_CC_003 (Pattern Recognition)

- Hands-on assessment during live session
- Good indicator of comprehension
- Review wrong answers to improve teaching

### Q_CC_004 (Post-class Quiz)

- 10 questions, mix conceptual and applied
- Target pass rate: 85%+
- Review failures to identify gaps

### Q_CC_005 (Real-World Assignment)

- Open-ended scenario
- Learners propose solutions
- Grade on reasoning + correctness

## 🔄 Common Misconceptions

| Misconception                       | Reality                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "More abstraction is always better" | Abstraction hides complexity. Too much and it confuses. |
| "You must use all SOLID principles" | Use them where they help. Context matters.              |
| "Patterns are required"             | Patterns are tools. Use them when appropriate.          |
| "Security is an afterthought"       | Security must be foundational.                          |

## 💻 Demo Code Snippets

Keep these ready to paste in your IDE:

```typescript
// Abstraction Example - Bad
class Car {
  private pistons = 1000;
  private cylinders = 4;
  private fuel = 50;

  public drive() {
    // User has to understand internals!
  }
}

// Abstraction Example - Good
class Car {
  public drive() {
    // User just calls drive()
  }
}
```

## 📋 Lesson Checklist

### Before Live Session (Day Before)

- [ ] Practice live coding demos 2-3 times
- [ ] Prepare slides (dry run through all 5)
- [ ] Test code examples in IDE
- [ ] Prepare poll questions backup
- [ ] Plan icebreaker or story to tell
- [ ] Check student pre-class completion rates
- [ ] Send reminder email

### During Live Session

- [ ] Start early for tech checks
- [ ] Share agenda at the start
- [ ] Use screen sharing + webcam
- [ ] Paste code examples clearly
- [ ] Monitor chat for questions
- [ ] Call on participants for engagement
- [ ] Record the entire session
- [ ] Watch timing (stay on schedule)

### After Live Session

- [ ] Compile Q&A transcript
- [ ] Share slides + code examples
- [ ] Highlight best student answers (anonymized)
- [ ] Share recording after the session
- [ ] Add captions after editing
- [ ] Review Q_CC_003 results
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't for next time

## 🎬 Recording & Distribution

- **Format**: Full video + slides overlay
- **Length**: Edit to a concise cut (remove dead air)
- **Captions**: Essential for accessibility
- **Audio**: Watch for echo/background noise
- **Video Quality**: 1080p preferred, 720p minimum

## 📞 Office Hours Prep

Likely office hours questions:

- "How do I convince my team to follow SOLID?"
- "What if the codebase doesn't allow patterns?"
- "How do I refactor existing code?"
- "When is it okay to take shortcuts?"
