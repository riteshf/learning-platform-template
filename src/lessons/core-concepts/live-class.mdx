# Live Class: Deep Dive into Core Concepts

**Date**: January 22, 2025 | **Time**: 6:00 PM UTC | **Duration**: 60 minutes

Get ready for a comprehensive, interactive deep dive! We'll move from theory to practice, discussing real-world applications and solving problems together.

## 📺 Session Agenda

### 1. Welcome Back & Recap (5 min)

- How the pre-class prep went
- Quick review of key definitions
- Overview of today's journey

### 2. Interactive Lecture: Principles in Action (20 min)

**Slides**: 01-foundations → 02-principles → 03-patterns

We'll explore:

- How each concept builds on the previous one
- Connections between concepts
- Why these principles endure despite changing technologies

**During this section:**

- Ask questions in the chat anytime
- Share your observations
- Draw parallels to your own experience

### 3. Pattern Recognition Activity (15 min)

**Slide**: 04-best-practices

Work through real-world code examples and identify:

- Which patterns are present?
- Which principles are violated?
- How would you refactor?

**Live Poll**: Which principle resonates most?

### 4. Live Coding Session (15 min)

**Interactive Coding Exercise**

Now it's time to get hands-on! Follow along as we implement a basic pattern together.

### 5. Case Study Analysis (10 min)

**Slide**: 05-case-studies

We'll examine 2-3 case studies showing:

- How successful companies apply these concepts
- Lessons learned from their implementations
- Common pitfalls and how they overcame them

### 6. Q&A & Open Discussion (5 min)

- Your burning questions answered
- Connections to your projects
- Preview of practical application in next lesson

## 🎬 Interactive Elements

### Live Coding Demo

Watch the instructor build a small project that demonstrates:

- How to apply multiple principles together
- Real-world decision-making
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

### Breakout Room Activity (optional)

- Small groups discuss how these concepts apply to specific domains
- Share findings with the larger group
- Network with peers
