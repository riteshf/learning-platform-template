Excellent work joining the live session! Now let's consolidate your learning through structured practice and reflection.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

You should now be able to:

- [ ] Explain each core concept in your own words
- [ ] Identify where concepts apply in real projects
- [ ] Recognize design patterns in existing code
- [ ] Make decisions based on core principles
- [ ] Mentor others on these concepts

## ✍️ Reflection Exercise

Reflect on the live session:

1. **"Aha!" moments**: What surprised you or clicked?
2. **Connections**: How do these concepts relate to your work?
3. **Questions**: What still feels unclear?
4. **Applications**: Where will you apply this immediately?

_Journal these thoughts — they're valuable for your learning journey._

## 📊 Knowledge Check Quiz

Test your mastery of core concepts with this multiple-choice quiz:

<!-- question:db:Q_CC_004 -->

## 🔍 Pattern Identification

Select all the valid design patterns from the following list (multiple correct answers):

<!-- question:db:Q_CC_005 -->

## ✍️ Fill in the Blanks: Key Terminology

Complete the following statements with the correct terminology:

<!-- question:db:Q_CC_006 -->

## 💻 Hands-On Practice Assignment

Apply what you've learned by building a small example:

<!-- question:db:Q_CC_007 -->

**What You'll Do:**

1. Read the coding scenario provided
2. Write the code that implements the core concepts
3. Test your solution
4. Submit for automated grading and instructor feedback
