# Pre-Class: Foundational Concepts

In this pre-class phase, we'll establish a strong foundation in the core concepts. This preparation is critical for getting the most out of the live session.

## 📝 Recap from Previous Lesson

Before diving into core concepts, let's reflect on what you learned in the introduction:

<!-- question:db:Q_CC_001 -->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this pre-class section, you'll be able to:

1. Define key terminology used throughout the course
2. Understand the historical context and evolution
3. Identify the main building blocks and components
4. Recognize real-world examples in practice

## 📚 Core Readings (20 min)

### 1. What Are Core Concepts?

Core concepts form the foundation upon which all advanced topics build. Think of them as the alphabet before writing poetry.

**Key Points:**

- Concepts are abstract ideas that organize information
- Each concept has properties, relationships, and applications
- Understanding relationships between concepts is as important as understanding individual concepts

**Real-World Analogy:**
Just as you need to understand "cells," "organisms," and "ecosystems" in biology, our field has its own hierarchy of concepts that build upon each other.

### 2. Historical Context

Understanding where these concepts came from helps us understand why they matter.

**Timeline:**

- **Phase 1**: Early foundations (1980s-1990s)
  - Pioneer researchers established basic principles
  - First implementations and use cases emerged
- **Phase 2**: Standardization (2000s)
  - Industry convergence around best practices
  - Formal specifications and standards published
- **Phase 3**: Modern era (2010s-present)
  - Tools and frameworks simplified adoption
  - Cloud and distributed systems accelerated evolution

### 3. Core Components (Foundational Model)

The fundamental model consists of three interconnected layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Application Layer                      │
│  (What users interact with)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Business Logic Layer                   │
│  (Core principles & patterns)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Foundation Layer                       │
│  (Core concepts & terminology)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer depends on the layer below it. We'll focus on the Foundation and Business Logic layers.

## 🧩 Key Terminology

Before the live session, familiarize yourself with these essential terms:

| Term              | Simple Definition                                        | Real-World Example                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding complexity behind a simple interface              | Remote control hides TV circuit complexity |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data with methods that operate on it            | Car keeps engine details internal          |
| **Modularity**    | Breaking systems into independent, interchangeable parts | LEGO bricks that snap together             |
| **Scalability**   | System's ability to handle growth                        | Restaurant that opens more locations       |
| **Resilience**    | System's ability to recover from failures                | Backup systems that activate on failure    |

## 🔗 How It Fits Together

```
CONCEPT A
    ↓ (depends on)
CONCEPT B
    ↓ (depends on)
CONCEPT C (Foundation)
```

Understanding the dependency chain helps you identify what to learn first.

## 💻 Interactive Exploration

Try to answer these questions before the live session (not graded):

1. **Recall**: Define abstraction in your own words
2. **Understand**: Why is modularity important in complex systems?
3. **Apply**: Identify abstractions in software you use daily (browsers, apps, etc.)
4. **Analyze**: How do these concepts relate to each other?

## 📋 Pre-Class Checklist

Before joining the live session:

- [ ] Read sections 1-3 above (20 minutes)
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with key terminology
- [ ] Answer the interactive questions
- [ ] Take the checklist quiz (Q_CC_001)
- [ ] Note any concepts that confuse you

## 🤔 Reflection Questions

Write these down and bring them to the live session:

1. Which concept seems most relevant to your work?
2. Where have you already encountered these ideas?
3. What aspects still seem unclear?
