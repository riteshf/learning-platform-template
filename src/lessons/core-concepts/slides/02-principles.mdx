# Slide 2: Core Principles

## The Five Pillars

### 1. **Abstraction**

**Hide complexity, show simplicity**

- Users interact with interfaces, not internals
- Good abstraction reveals intent
- Bad abstraction obscures understanding

Example: Your car's steering wheel is an abstraction. You don't think about hydraulics.

### 2. **Modularity**

**Build systems from independent parts**

- Each module has a single, clear purpose
- Modules should be loosely coupled
- Easy to test, replace, or upgrade individual modules

Example: LEGO bricks. Each brick is independent and connects easily.

### 3. **Composition**

**Build complex behavior from simple building blocks**

- Many small pieces combined create sophistication
- Easier to understand and maintain
- More flexible than monolithic approaches

### 4. **Encapsulation**

**Bundle data with the operations that use it**

- Information hiding: internal state is private
- External interface: what others can call
- Change internals without breaking external contracts

### 5. **Scalability**

**Design for growth without redesign**

- Horizontal scaling: add more machines
- Vertical scaling: add more power to existing machines
- Database design for billions of records
- APIs that grow with usage
