# Slide 3: Design Patterns

## Proven Solutions to Common Problems

A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in a given context.

### Pattern Categories

**Creational Patterns** (How to create objects)

- Singleton: Ensure only one instance exists
- Factory: Create objects without specifying classes
- Builder: Construct complex objects step-by-step

**Structural Patterns** (How to compose objects)

- Adapter: Make incompatible interfaces compatible
- Facade: Provide simplified interface to complex system
- Proxy: Provide a placeholder for another object

**Behavioral Patterns** (How objects interact)

- Observer: Notify multiple objects of state changes
- Strategy: Encapsulate algorithm families
- State: Allow objects to change behavior when state changes

### Pattern Recognition Exercise

Can you identify the pattern in this pseudocode?

```
User registers for course
    → Notification system alerted
    → Email sent
    → SMS sent
    → Analytics updated
    → Dashboard updated
```

**Pattern**: **Observer** - One object (registration event) triggers multiple listeners.

### Anti-Patterns: Patterns to Avoid

- **God Object**: One class doing everything
- **Spaghetti Code**: Complex, tangled dependencies
- **Copy-Paste Code**: DRY violation (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring

## Real-World Pattern Usage

| Pattern   | Real-World Example       | Why It Works                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Singleton | Database connection pool | Only one needed, shared access      |
| Factory   | UI framework buttons     | Create different types uniformly    |
| Observer  | Event listeners          | Decouple event source from handlers |
| Strategy  | Payment methods          | Switch algorithms at runtime        |
