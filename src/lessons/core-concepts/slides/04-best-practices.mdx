# Slide 4: Best Practices

## Industry-Tested Wisdom

Best practices emerge from collective experience across many projects and years.

### 1. **Write Readable Code**

```javascript
// ❌ Clever but confusing
const r = a
  .filter((x) => x > 0)
  .map((x) => x * 2)
  .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

// ✅ Clear and maintainable
const positiveNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num > 0);
const doubled = positiveNumbers.map((num) => num * 2);
const sum = doubled.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
```

**Why**: You'll spend more time reading code than writing it.

### 2. **Follow SOLID Principles**

- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes should be substitutable
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many specific interfaces > one general
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. **DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself**

```javascript
// ❌ Repeated code
function getUserData(id) {
  /* ... */
}
function getAdminData(id) {
  /* ... */
}
function getModeratorData(id) {
  /* ... */
}

// ✅ Extracted common logic
function getUserData(id, role) {
  /* ... */
}
```

### 4. **Test Your Code**

- Unit tests: Test individual functions
- Integration tests: Test components working together
- End-to-end tests: Test full user workflows
- Aim for 70%+ code coverage

### 5. **Document Your Code**

- Why decisions were made (comments)
- How to use your code (docstrings/JSDoc)
- Complex algorithms need explanation
- Keep docs in sync with code

### 6. **Version Control Wisely**

- Meaningful commit messages
- Small, focused commits
- Feature branches before merging
- Pull request reviews

### 7. **Performance Matters**

- Measure before optimizing
- Identify bottlenecks
- Profile your code
- Balance optimization with readability

### 8. **Security First**

- Validate all inputs
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use established libraries
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits

## Checklist for Code Review

Before submitting code:

- [ ] Does it follow the project's style guide?
- [ ] Is it readable and well-commented?
- [ ] Have I written tests?
- [ ] Does it handle edge cases?
- [ ] Is performance acceptable?
- [ ] Have I considered security?
- [ ] Is it DRY (not repeated)?
- [ ] Does it follow SOLID principles?
