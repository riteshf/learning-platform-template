## Instructor Notes: Introduction Lesson

Keep these notes light so instructors can scan quickly.

### What to emphasize

- Hybrid rhythm: prep → live → practice
- Where learners ask for help
- How questions are injected (IDs only, backend renders)

### Flow (adaptable)

- Icebreaker
- Slides: welcome → core-concept → expectations
- Run poll Q_INTRO_002 and adjust pace
- Q&A, preview next lesson

### Watch outs

- New to the stack? Slow down and share links
- Low participation? Use chat prompts and cold-call gently
- Tech hiccups? Have a backup meeting link handy

### Quick checklist

- [ ] Test meeting + recording
- [ ] Slides ready
- [ ] Poll ID handy: Q_INTRO_002
- [ ] Reminder queued after class
